# Embedded Systems Diploma Overview

## Program Details

- **Diploma:** Embedded Systems
- **Institution:** Kernel Masters

## Learnings

I have successfully completed an Embedded Systems diploma with Kernel Masters, where I gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in various concepts.

## Key Concepts Covered

### Microcontroller Interfacing

- Developed device drivers for the PIC18F family.
- Implemented drivers for the following functionalities:
  - GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
  - Interrupt handling
  - ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
  - EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)
  - UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)
  - I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
  - SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)

### Microcontroller Used

- Utilized the PIC18F4620 microcontroller as the primary platform for practical applications.

## Projects

I applied the acquired skills to create a variety of projects, including:

1. **Smart Home System:**
   - Integrated GPIO for controlling devices.
   - Utilized UART for communication.
   - Implemented I2C for sensor integration.

2. **Temperature Control System:**
   - Utilized ADC for temperature sensing.
   - Integrated GPIO for controlling heating or cooling elements.
   - Implemented interrupt handling for efficient system response.

These projects showcase my proficiency in microcontroller programming and interfacing, demonstrating practical applications in both residential automation and temperature regulation systems.
