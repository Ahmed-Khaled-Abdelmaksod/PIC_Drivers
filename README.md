## Key Concepts Covered

### Microcontroller Interfacing

In this module, I delved into the intricacies of microcontroller interfacing, honing my skills in developing various device drivers for the PIC18F family. The drivers created include:

- **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output):** Controlling digital signals for interfacing with external devices.
- **Interrupt Handling:** Managing interrupts to respond to specific events in real-time.
- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter):** Converting analog signals into digital values for processing.
- **EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory):** Storing non-volatile data for future use.
- **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter):** Enabling serial communication with other devices.
- **I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit):** Facilitating communication between integrated circuits.
- **Timers:** Precision timing for various applications.
- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface):** Serial communication protocol for device communication.
- **BUTTON:** Interfacing with push buttons for user input.
- **CHARACTER LCD:** Displaying alphanumeric characters for user feedback.
- **DC MOTOR:** Controlling the speed and direction of DC motors.
- **KEYPAD:** Capturing user input through a keypad.
- **LED:** Managing light-emitting diodes for visual indicators.
- **RELAY:** Controlling high-power devices using low-power signals.
- **SEVEN SEGMENT DISPLAY:** Displaying numerical information in a seven-segment format.

*Note: The documentation for these drivers is comprehensive and highly beneficial, providing detailed explanations and usage guidelines.*

### Microcontroller Used

I extensively worked with the PIC18F4620 microcontroller throughout this module, gaining practical experience and insight into its capabilities.

## Projects

I applied my acquired knowledge and utilized these drivers to create several projects, including:

1. **Smart Home System:**
   - Integrated GPIO, UART, I2C for communication, and BUTTON for user input.
   - Controlled devices such as LED, RELAY, and DC MOTOR for home automation.

2. **Temperature Control System:**
   - Utilized ADC for temperature sensing.
   - Integrated GPIO, CHARACTER LCD, and RELAY for precise temperature control.

These projects underscore my proficiency in microcontroller programming and interfacing, showcasing practical applications in both residential automation and temperature regulation systems.
